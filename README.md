[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sanbeg/StripeDecoration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sanbeg/StripeDecoration)

Android library to decorate a RecyclerView with alternating stripes. You
would typically provide a single stripe, to alternate between striped and
plain rows, but can also provide arbitrary numbers of stripes for it to
iterate through.  It works with vertical, horizontal, and even grids.
